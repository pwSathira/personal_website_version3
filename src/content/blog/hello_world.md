## Who am I?
I'm unemployed, and also Sathira Williams a new graduate from York University. I did a degree in software engineering, and have spent my life preparing myself for a software engineering role. 

I started my journey to tech at a very young age, I destroyed my parents valuable harddrive of photos and videos to install Ubuntu on my desktop. I was always interested in the tech, and software I would experiement with mods on Minecraft, and then hack my Roblox games to play music I listened too to the entire lobby.

From then I made games, programmed, and learnt throughout highschool and then university applying myself. Whether it be creating a satellite scheduler for the Canadian Space Agency, or making this very website you are on right now, I loved creating software. 

## The Point?
I am going to document this journey as I attempt to entry the industry. These days the industry is *cooked*, thousands applying to an entry level job, people faking qualifications on their resume, and cheating their way through the system. 

It isn't right, and frankly, it's disheartening. It makes the path for genuine, hardworking individuals like myself even steeper.

But I refuse to believe that genuine effort and passion don't count anymore. This blog is my stand. I want to show – perhaps to myself as much as to anyone else – that if you remain dedicated to your craft, continuously learn, and stay motivated, you can still make it.

Here, I'll be sharing the unvarnished reality of this pursuit:

- Project Deep Dives: The cool things I'm building, the technologies I'm exploring, and the lessons learned (both successes and "valuable learning experiences," aka bugs!).
- The Job Hunt Saga: My experiences with applications, networking, interviews (the good, the bad, and the baffling), and any tips I pick up.
- Learning Logs: What new skills I'm acquiring, interesting concepts I'm grappling with, courses I'm taking, and resources I find valuable.

Wish me luck. I have a feeling I'll need it, but I'm also bringing a whole lot of determination and a genuine love for this field to the table. Let's see where this journey goes.
