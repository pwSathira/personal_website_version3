## Who am I?
I'm unemployed, and also Sathira Williams a new graduate from York University. I did a degree in software engineering, and have spent my life preparing myself for a software engineering role. 

I started my journey to tech at a very young age, I destroyed my parents valuable harddrive of photos and videos to install Ubuntu on my desktop. I was always interested in the tech, and software I would experiement with mods on Minecraft, and then hack my Roblox games to play music I listened too to the entire lobby.

From then I made games, programmed, and learnt throughout highschool and then university applying myself. Whether it be creating a satellite scheduler for the Canadian Space Agency, or making this very website you are on right now, I loved creating software. 

## The Point?
Here, I'll be sharing the reality of this pursuit:

- Project Deep Dives: The cool things I'm building, the technologies I'm exploring, and the lessons learned
- The Job Hunt Saga: My experiences with applications, networking, interviews (the good, the bad, and the baffling), and any tips I pick up.
- Learning Logs: What new skills I'm acquiring, interesting concepts I'm grappling with, courses I'm taking, and resources I find valuable.

Wish me luck. I have a feeling I'll need it, but I'm also bringing a whole lot of determination and a genuine love for this field to the table. Let's see where this journey goes.
